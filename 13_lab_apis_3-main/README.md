Tired of the same music? Looking for some good Reggaeton?...don't worry, here you have the marvelous Spotify Web API :boom: :boom: :boom:

---

## :wrench: __First things first:__ CONFIG YOUR ACCESS!

Just go to your Spotify account dashboard and create an __WEB APP__ using your user account.

> __IMPORTANT:__ you'll need you __Client ID__ and __Client Secret__ in order to get your access __token__.

---

## :hammer: __Basic Challenge__

In the [__development notebook__](https://github.com/potacho/spotichallenge/blob/master/notebooks/spotify_rest_api_challenge.ipynb) you must create a a new spotify track list from any of the 13 artists listed. 

> __IMPORTANT:__ first you must get the related artist and the get the most popular songs from each of them in order to create the new list.

---

### :bulb: BONUS (yeah, there's always a Bonus  :see_no_evil:)

You can create a new Playlist and fill it with your new track list using the `POST` method (further instructions in Notebook).

---

### :bulb: BONUS 2

If you still feel strong, refactor your code and create a data pipeline (i.e.: `main.py`).
